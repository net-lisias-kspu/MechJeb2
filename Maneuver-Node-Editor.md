_Maneuver Node Editor_ window allows precise adjustments to your manevuers. Changes by clicking a button are immediately reflected to the manuever node, but to propagate changes in the text fields, you must click update.
All three vectors (prograde, normal, radial) can be changed as well as time. For time, you can click a button to move the node to various orbit points. This window also offers autopilot.
