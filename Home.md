Welcome to the MechJeb2 wiki!

## How to help

- Fly with MechJeb! Use it on your rockets, experiment with its features, and let us know what would make it better.
- Take a look at the **[issues](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/issues)** page and see if there are any for which you can provide extra detail.

## Filing an issue
If you find a bug, you can help us solve it. First, look at the [list of issues](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/issues) &mdash; there's a chance someone else has already reported the same problem. If so, you should add a comment to the already-existing issue with any details you can provide.

If the issue hasn't been filed already, please [make a new issue](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/issues/new) with the following information:
- the version of MechJeb you're using
- the steps needed to reproduce the problem (link to a .craft or persistence file if necessary)

If you're requesting a new feature, you can skip the "steps to reproduce" and instead describe:
- why the feature would be useful to you (it may not be obvious to us)

Finally, stay tuned to the issue &mdash; we may ask follow-up questions or ask you to test a potential fix.
