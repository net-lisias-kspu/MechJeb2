## Common Issues

1. Why is the Mechjeb menu not showing?

    Make sure you have the part on your ship (AR202 case in the Control section). 

2. (Windows) I cannot find Mechjeb anywhere, there aren't even parts in the R&D facility!

    Some Windows protection and anti-virus software can sometimes block KSP from loading MechJeb.
    You should install KSP outside the `C:\Program Files (x86)\` directory. [Steam has an option to change the install directory](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7710-tdlc-0426) of a game or you can just copy the directory somewhere else.

3. Why is some Mechjeb function not available?

    Science and career mode require requires to unlock some specific node in the Research and Development tree. 
    Some other also require to upgrade the tracking station to level 2 (game code restriction we can't do much about).
